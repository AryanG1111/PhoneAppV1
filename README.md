This is our submission for ROBOHackIT 2022.

Inspiration
Many study tools nowadays are not easily accessible or free. We aimed to build an app that made studying simple and efficient.

What it does
The user specifies the subject they want to study and problems are then taken from a problem set with adaptive difficulty. The user also has the options to customize their study experience by entering preferred difficulty, feedback, and number of problems.

How we built it
We built this application mostly using Android Studio. We used a few Python Scripts to create the question files.

Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into were figuring out a way to get and represent question. Originally, we did not have enough information per question and we created too many question files, which made it difficult to keep track of.

Accomplishments we are proud of
It was our first app development experience and our first time participating in a hackathon. Overall, we are proud of the amount of work we were able to do.

What we learned
We learned the basics of app development and UI, ie. activities, layouts, etc.

What's next
There is definitely a lot of room to improve. One of our ideas is to add more types of problems (free response, matching) and a feature for teachers to be able to create their own problems (Teacher account/Student account).
